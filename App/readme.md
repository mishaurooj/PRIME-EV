# PRIME-EV Interactive Decision Dashboard

PRIME-EV is an interactive Streamlit dashboard for EV charging station prioritization. It lets you enter a station ID such as `EVS00001` or `EVS00050`, then runs station-level risk assessment, utility ranking, deployment impact analysis, baseline comparison, similarity search, map visualization, and top-priority station screening.

## Required Dataset

Place the EV charging station dataset at:

```text
D:\other\prime-ev\Dataset\ev_charging_stations-dataset.csv
```

The dashboard also supports manual CSV upload from the sidebar.

Expected dataset size used in the dashboard:

```text
5,000 EV charging stations
Station IDs: EVS00001 to EVS05000
```

Required columns include:

```text
Station ID
Address
Charger Type
Station Operator
Connector Types
Availability
Cost (USD/kWh)
Distance to City (km)
Usage Stats (avg users/day)
Charging Capacity (kW)
Installation Year
Reviews (Rating)
Parking Spots
Renewable Energy Source
Maintenance Frequency
Latitude
Longitude
```

## Environment Setup

### Option 1: Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n prime-ev python=3.10 -y
conda activate prime-ev
```

Install packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly pydeck
```

### Option 2: Requirements File

Create `requirements.txt` with:

```text
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
plotly
pydeck
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Dashboard

Go to the application folder:

```bash
cd /d D:\other\prime-ev\App\Code
```

Start Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run prime_ev_dashboard.py
```

Open the local URL shown in the terminal:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

## How to Use

1. Start the dashboard.
2. Upload the EV charging station CSV from the sidebar if the file is not auto-loaded.
3. Enter a station ID, for example:

```text
EVS00001
EVS00050
EVS02775
```

4. Adjust the Top-K slider to control how many priority stations are displayed.
5. Use the tabs to inspect:
   - Station Analysis
   - Model and Baselines
   - Planning Visuals
   - Top Stations
   - Raw Data

## Main Dashboard Outputs

### Station-Level Outputs

The dashboard computes:

```text
PRIME-EV utility score
PRIME-EV risk score
Deployment impact score
Demand-capacity fit
Cost-accessibility fit
Network rank
```

Example output for `EVS00050`:

```text
Network rank: 1,070 of 5,000
Utility score: 56.1/100
Risk score: 39.8/100
Deployment impact: 59.4/100
Demand-capacity fit: 78.8/100
```

### Baseline Methods

The app compares PRIME-EV with practical prioritization baselines:

```text
DistanceOnly
QualityGreen
Gradient-Boosted Ranker
AHP
Random Forest
MultiObjective
DemandCapacity
CostOnly
```

These comparisons help verify whether PRIME-EV gives a balanced decision rather than ranking stations using a single factor.

### Planning Visuals

The dashboard provides:

```text
Risk vs utility scatter plot
Geographic station map
Similar-station table
Top priority station table
Top station utility chart
Raw filtered dataset
```

## Export Results

Use the **Download filtered station results** button in the Raw Data tab to export the processed station table.

The exported file contains the original station attributes plus PRIME-EV outputs:

```text
PRIME_UtilityScore_100
PRIME_RiskScore_100
PRIME_DeploymentImpact_100
NetworkRank
```

## Screenshot Guidance for Papers

For paper figures, avoid one long full-page screenshot. Use separate panels:

```text
(a) Executive dashboard
(b) Station profile and diagnostic radar
(c) Baseline comparison
(d) Risk versus utility planning view
(e) Geographic station map and similar stations
(f) Top priority station results
```

For full-page capture in Chrome:

```text
F12 → Ctrl + Shift + P → Capture full size screenshot
```

For Microsoft Edge:

```text
Web Capture → Capture Full Page
```

Recommended export quality:

```text
300 dpi minimum
600 dpi preferred for IEEE submission
```

## Notes

- The dashboard is designed for decision support and planning analysis.
- PRIME-EV scores are normalized to a 0 to 100 range for interpretability.
- The map requires valid `Latitude` and `Longitude` columns.
- If a station ID is not found, check the format. Use five digits after `EVS`, such as `EVS00001`.

## Citation Statement

If you use this dashboard in a paper, describe it as:

```text
The PRIME-EV dashboard provides station-level decision support by integrating utility ranking, risk estimation, deployment impact scoring, baseline comparison, geospatial inspection, and similar-station retrieval in an interactive Streamlit interface.
```
